To add duck to existing user:

create featureSet
save featureSet
create duck
set featureSet to duck
set user (owner) to duck
get ducks from user
add duck to user ducks
save duck


while extracting user, user's ducks are also extracted
while extracting event/meeting, place is also extracted
while extracting duck, duck's user and feature set are also extracted

need (?) methods for extracting:

from user:
    - requests
    - ducks

from duck:
    - user
    - feature set

from event:
    - place

How ducks can be retrieved?
    - from user
    - from request (request -> user -> duck)
    - global search (get all) (with user)

How requests can be retrieved?

How users can be retrieved?
    - from duck (duck search -> duck -> user)
    - from request (request -> user)
    - global search (get all) (only user)
    - from event (TODO: add organiser fields and joins in db requests)


Global duck search:

search by feature set
get all ducks with feature sets and owners

Global person search:

search by nickname/email/whatever
get users by nickname/email/whatever

*after clicking on user*
going to profile
get ducks by owner id

In your profile:

get with ducks

*after clicking my requests*
get with requests
