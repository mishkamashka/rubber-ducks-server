To add duck to existing user:

create featureSet
save featureSet
create duck
set featureSet to duck
set user (owner) to duck
get ducks from user
add duck to user ducks
save duck


while extracting user, user's ducks are also extracted
while extracting event/meeting, place is also extracted
while extracting duck, duck's user and feature set are also extracted

need (?) methods for extracting:

from user:
    - requests
    - ducks

from duck:
    - user
    - feature set

from event/meeting:
    - place

How ducks can be retrieved?
    - from user
    - from request (request -> user -> duck)
    - global search (get all)

How requests can be retrieved?

How users can be retrieved?
    - from duck (duck search -> duck -> user)
    - from request (request -> user)
    - global search (get all)
    - from event/meeting (TODO: add organiser fields and joins in db requests)
